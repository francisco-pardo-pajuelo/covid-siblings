% 1. Motivation (1 Pargraph)


% Learning losses from school closures
%During the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures, many countries implemented some form of remote learning. Suddenly without the usual school inputs,  parents had a bigger role in the education of their children. This period caused significant learning losses, especially for more vulnerable populations (\cite{haelermans_inequality_2022}, \cite{jakubowski_global_2023}). Yet, with parents as a more relevant input in the education production function and remote schooling that required digital resources, there is no evidence on how the size of the household could have affected children's learning.


% Siblings did much worse (PISA score)

% Questions about family size being relevant?


% 2. Research question


% 6. Roadmap of paper.
The paper proceeds as follows. \hyperref[sec:empirical_strategy]{Section \ref{sec:empirical_strategy}} details the empirical approach. \hyperref[sec:data]{Section \ref{sec:data}}  describes the higher education system in Peru and linked administrative data. \hyperref[sec:results]{Section \ref{sec:results}} presents results. \hyperref[sec:mechanisms]{Section \ref{sec:mechanisms}} discusses potential mechanisms. \hyperref[sec:heterogeneity]{Section \ref{sec:heterogeneity}} discusses heterogeneity in results. \hyperref[sec:robustness]{Section \ref{sec:robustness}} shows robustness checks. \hyperref[sec:policy]{Section \ref{sec:policy}} discusses policy implications. \hyperref[sec:conclusions]{Section \ref{sec:conclusions}} concludes.

\subsection{Expectations over educational attainment}

Using ECE survey from before and after covid we perform simple TWFE estimations. In \textcolor{green}{Table...} we see a reduction in parental expectations for attaining a 4-year college degree and an increase of those who believe the maximum level of education will be high-school.

% Robustness and Mechanisms
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Mechanisms}\label{sec:mechanisms}

Them main potential mechanisms are...

\subsection{Birth Order}

Results hold when working only with first births

\subsection{Socio economic and human capital constraints in the household}

Results hold when controlling for level of education, internet and pc.

We also look into the number of rooms

\subsection{Sibling disruptions}

Results hold when doing age gap.

\subsection{Parental time and investment}

Results by single/both parents. Other adults in the household.

Results from RD of SSA

Results from \hyperref[tab:rd_summ_1_m_a_365]{Table \ref{tab:rd_summ_1_m_a_365}} show how delaying school has a negative effect in the older sibling. \footenote{a}

\subsection{Income}

Results from socio-economic status show that... 
This is highly correlated with income... (show)
However, it is certainly not a malleable, but it is evidence that there is not differential loss in income driving the results.

Perhaps show that there are losses of socio-economic status overall? Can we do this with household surveys or with the ECE surveys themselves?

\section{Heterogeneity}\label{sec:heterogeneity}

Surprisingly, results are consistent across...

\subsection{Reinforcement vs Compensation}

\section{Robustness}\label{sec:robustness}

\subsection{Potential sample selection}

Discuss how siblings are observed. We only see observations as long as they are enrolled in data. Most children are enrolled in primary school \textcolor{green}{(show data from household surveys)}. However, most children are not enrolled until 3-4 years old. Since our last year of administrative data is 2024, this means that some families with 2 children, one of which was born after 2021, might be observed as only childs. To address any concerns from this selection I do the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item These families are not particularly different from others? (this true)?
    \item I use data up to 2023 and 2022 to define families (and potentially imposing a similar bias to earlier years) and still see results change around COVID. \textcolor{green}{Pending Analyis}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Siblings in same vs different schools}

\subsection{Different definitions of siblings: father, both, caretaker}

\subsection{Younger and middle child}

\subsection{Unadjusted scores}

%We argue that an older siblingâ€™s enrollment in a higher quality college can provide for families information about postsecondary education that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain. [draft US]
