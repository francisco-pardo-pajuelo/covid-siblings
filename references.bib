	abstract = {Supportive family relationships may mitigate the impact of the Covid19 pandemic on young children's adjustment, but existing work is limited by its focus on within-country variation and parental influences. Addressing these gaps, and drawing on reported buffering effects of older siblings on child mental health (Lawson and Mace, 2010), the current international study examined whether child adjustment problems were, on average, elevated by the pandemic and whether this buffering effect of older siblings would be maintained. In the first wave of the Covid19 pandemic (April to July 2020), 2516 parents of 3- to 8-year-old children living in Australia, China, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States of America—six countries with contrasting governmental responses to the pandemic—completed an online survey about family experiences and relationships and child adjustment, as indexed by ratings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ: R. Goodman, 1997). As expected, child SDQ total difficulty scores were elevated in all sites except Sweden (which notably did not enforce mass school closures). Compared to children without siblings, children with one or more older siblings showed fewer adjustment problems. Children from lone-parent households displayed more adjustment problems, as did those whose parents reported increased sibling conflict. Finally, child adjustment problems were negatively associated with family socio-economic status, but positively related to the indices of Covid-19 family disruption and government stringency. We discuss these findings in relation to existing work on asymmetric effects of older versus younger siblings, and siblings as sources of support.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The present study aimed to explore the effect of risk factors associated with the COVID-19 outbreak experience on parents' and children's well-being.


Methods: Parents of children aged between 2- and 14-years-old completed an online survey reporting their home environment conditions, any relation they had to the pandemic consequences, their difficulties experienced due to the quarantine, their perception of individual and parent-child dyadic stress, and their children's emotional and behavioral problems.


Results: Results showed that the perception of the difficulty of quarantine is a crucial factor that undermines both parents' and children's well-being. Quarantine's impact on children's behavioral and emotional problems is mediated by parent's individual and dyadic stress, with a stronger effect from the latter. Parents who reported more difficulties in dealing with quarantine show more stress. This, in turn, increases the children's problems. Living in a more at-risk area, the quality of the home environment, or the relation they have with the pandemic consequences, do not have an effect on families' well-being.


Conclusions: Dealing with quarantine is a particularly stressful experience for parents who must balance personal life, work, and raising children, being left alone without other resources. This situation puts parents at a higher risk of experiencing distress, potentially impairing their ability to be supportive caregivers. The lack of support these children receive in such a difficult moment may be the reason for their more pronounced psychological symptoms. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health, and supportive interventions for the immediate and for the future should be promoted.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined remote learning practices and difficulties during initial stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: Participants were 238 adolescents (132 males; 118 with ADHD) aged 15.64-17.99 years and their parents. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires in May/June 2020 when in-person schools were closed in the U.S.
RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and only 59\% of school-based services received before COVID-19 continued during COVID-19 remote learning. Adolescents with ADHD had fewer routines and more remote learning difficulties than adolescents without ADHD. Parents of adolescents with ADHD had less confidence in managing remote learning and more difficulties in supporting home learning and home-school communication. Thirty-one percent of parents of adolescents with ADHD with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or receiving academic accommodations (504 Plan) reported remote learning to be very challenging, compared with 18\% of parents of adolescents with ADHD without an IEP/504 Plan, and only 4\% of parents of adolescents with neither ADHD nor an IEP/504 Plan. Fewer adolescent routines, higher negative affect, and more difficulty concentrating because of COVID-19 were each associated with greater adolescent remote learning difficulties only in adolescents with ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial findings of the nature and impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative for schools and communities to provide the necessary supports to adolescents, particularly those with mental health and/or learning difficulties, and to their parents.},

Parents and youth participating in an ongoing longitudinal study in five Midwestern states in the United States completed an additional web-based assessment of family processes and family relationship qualities during the May-June 2020 pandemic-related shutdowns. A series of two-wave latent change score models indicated that family chaos increased with the onset of pandemic-related shutdowns and that the level of chaos within a family during the shutdowns had implications for changes in several parenting processes and family relationship qualities. Specifically, higher levels of family chaos during the pandemic mitigated observed increases in parental knowledge and were associated with declines in parental autonomy granting. Family chaos during pandemic-related shutdowns also was associated with increases in maternal-child conflict, paternal-child conflict, and sibling conflict as well as decreases in paternal-child intimacy, sibling intimacy, and sibling disclosure. Overall, consistent with a family stress perspective, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased strain and commotion within many households, and these changes had implications for multiple family relationships.},

	abstract = {Background
The impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on public mental health in 2019 is verified, but the role of only-child status in the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic has not been investigated and is not clear.
Objective
Our study aims to assess the impact of only-child status on the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The exposure risk to COVID-19, adverse experience, parent-child relationship, and resilience have also been measured and considered.
Methods
From March 20 to 31, 2020, a cross-sectional survey test was conducted on 11,681 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle schools (Grade 7 to Grade 9) across five provinces in China. The self-reported online questionnarie was used to collected data of demographic information, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the exposure risk to COVID-19.
Results
A total of 11,180 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 95.7\%. 35.2\% of only children and 38.8\% of non-only children reported depression symptoms, while 20.5\% of only children and 24.7\% of non-only children reported anxiety symptoms. It was significant that non-only children were more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms than only children (OR = 1.164, 95\%CI: 1.064–1.273, p = 0.001). The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was a risk factor of depression (OR = 2.284, 95\%CI: 1.640–3.180, p {\textless} 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.959, 95\%CI: 1.402–2.737, p {\textless} 0.001) in non-only children, but not in only children. For both only children and non-only children, the resilience and parent-child relationship were protective factors of depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse was a risk factor (p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion
The non-only children are more likely to develop the symptoms of anxiety and depression than only children, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The adolescents with siblings are psychiatrically more vulnerable to exposure risk of COVID-19 and need more attention, especially those with poor parent-child relationship, low resilience and experience of emotional abuse.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to illuminate the implications of COVID-19 school closures for sibling dynamics among Latinx school-age children in the U.S. and to examine family and cultural factors that may have conditioned school closure effects. Data came from an ongoing study of Latinx families in Arizona that collected home visit and survey data prepandemic (fall 2019; T1) and daily diary data during the outbreak (February to May 2020; T2). The analyses focused on 215 Latinx children (47\% female; Mage = 9.72, SD = 1.22; 88\% Mexican-origin) from 116 families (T1 family income median = \$27,600, SD = \$24,421). Multilevel tobit regression models were estimated to examine associations linking both T2 school closure and number of days since school closure with daily sibling positivity and negativity. The models also tested moderation effects of T1 family socioeconomic status, sibship size, child enculturation, and prior sibling positivity and negativity on these associations. Results showed that, although main effects of school closure on sibling dynamics were nonsignificant, school closure was linked to more sibling positivity in families with more children and among more enculturated children, and days since school closure was linked to more sibling positivity in families with more children and to lower sibling negativity among those with less prepandemic sibling negativity. Findings highlight differentiated effects of COVID-19 school closures on sibling dynamics among Latinx children whose families have been disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, illuminate the role of Latinx family cultural strengths, and have implications for intervention programs and public policies.

We exploit within-state variation in the timing of school closures from August 2020 to June 2021, controlling flexibly for demographic and state-level factors. We find that an increase in the proportion of remote instruction districts correlates with an escalation in parental mental health issues, including heightened anxiety, worry, depression, and a loss of interest in activities. These adverse effects are significantly lessened among parents who choose homeschooling. A one percentage point increase in the share of remote instruction in the state is associated with a 2.2 percentage point rise in homeschooling probability. Our paper contributes to understanding the wider impact of pandemic-induced educational changes, highlighting substantial mental health implications for parents.

	abstract = {The transition to remote learning in the context of COVID-19 led to dramatic setbacks in education. Is the return to in-person classes sufficient to eliminate these losses eventually? We study this question using data from the universe of secondary students in São Paulo State, Brazil. We estimate the causal medium-run impacts of the length of exposure to remote learning during the pandemic through a triple-differences strategy, which contrasts changes in educational outcomes across municipalities and grades that resumed in-person classes earlier (already by Q4/2020) or only in 2021. We find that relative learning losses from longer exposure to remote learning did not fade out over time—attesting that school reopening was at the same time key but not enough to mitigate accumulated learning losses in face of persistence. Using observational and experimental variation in local responses across 645 municipalities, we further document that remedial educational policies in the aftermath of the pandemic boosted learning recovery.},

Observations were weighted by district enrollment, and SEs were clustered at the district level.The dataset includes 11 017 school districts for 2 years and 22 034 observations. Chronic absenteeism rates increased by 13.5 percentage points, from a mean (SD) of 15.9\% (8.1\%) in the 2018-2019 school year to 29.4\% (13.2\%) in the 2021-2022 school year. Students whose schools had 100\% virtual instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic had chronic absenteeism rates that were 6.9 percentage points (95\% CI, 4.8-8.9 percentage points) higher than those that were 100\% in person. Hybrid instruction was not associated with increased absenteeism. The association between virtual learning and chronic absenteeism varied by socioeconomic status, with the conditional correlation much larger for at-risk students; chronic absenteeism rates were 10.6 percentage points (95\% CI, 7.2-14.1 percentage points) higher among students with 100\% of days in virtual learning from districts in the top quintile of poverty rates compared with 100\% in-persion districts.In this cross-sectional study, chronic absenteeism rates were substantially higher in school districts that used virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with in person. Understanding how to reduce chronic absenteeism and use virtual learning without potentially negative consequences are key policy questions moving forward.},

	abstract = {We build a publicly available database that tracks economic activity in the United States at a granular level in real time using anonymized data from private companies. We report weekly statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, job postings, and employment rates disaggregated by county, sector, and income group. Using the publicly available data, we show how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its effects across subgroups. High-income individuals reduced spending sharply in March 2020, particularly in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of small businesses in affluent, dense areas. Those businesses laid off many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses, especially among low-wage workers in such areas. High-wage workers experienced a V-shaped recession that lasted a few weeks, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger, more persistent job losses. Even though consumer spending and job postings had recovered fully by December 2021, employment rates in low-wage jobs remained depressed in areas that were initially hard hit, indicating that the temporary fall in labor demand led to a persistent reduction in labor supply. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we evaluate the effects of fiscal stimulus policies designed to stem the downward spiral in economic activity. Cash stimulus payments led to sharp increases in spending early in the pandemic, but much smaller responses later in the pandemic, especially for high-income households. Real-time estimates of marginal propensities to consume provided better forecasts of the impacts of subsequent rounds of stimulus payments than historical estimates. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal policies can stem secondary declines in consumer spending and job losses, but cannot restore full employment when the initial shock to consumer spending arises from health concerns. More broadly, our analysis demonstrates how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and real-time policy analyses, providing a new tool for empirical macroeconomics.},

	abstract = {We analyze data from approximately 7,800 school districts to describe variation in pandemic-related learning losses among communities and student subgroups. We attempt to understand mechanisms that led to learning losses, as well as explore how historical data from those districts can inform our expectations for how quickly districts will rebound from such losses. We show that learning losses during the pandemic were large and highly variable among communities. Similar to previous research, we find that losses were larger in lower-income and minority districts and in districts which remained remote or hybrid for longer periods during the 2020-21 school year. Among districts, the math learning loss per week of remote/hybrid instruction was larger in high-minority and high-poverty districts. Within districts, however, White students and non-economically disadvantaged students lost about the same amount of ground as Black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students. This suggests that the mechanisms driving losses operated at the district or community level, rather than household level. Several community-level characteristics were related to learning losses: broadband access, disruptions to social and economic activity, and trust in government institutions. However, no individual predictor provided strong explanatory power. Relative to historical years, losses during the pandemic were substantial, and an exploratory analysis of historical shocks to achievement suggests that the effects of the pandemic are likely to persist without continued concerted investments in student learning.},

Using administrative data on phone calls to the helpline for domestic violence (Línea 100), we find that the incidence rate of the calls increased by 48 percent between April and July 2020, with effects increasing over time. The rise in calls is found across all states and it is not driven by baseline characteristics, including previous prevalence of violence against women. These findings create the need to identify policies to mitigate the negative impact of stay-at-home orders on women’s safety.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures implemented have generated an environment conducive to an increase in domestic violence. This study aimed to evaluate changes in calls reporting domestic violence to Línea 100 in Peru before, during and after strict lockdown, using a controlled interrupted time series analysis.
Methods
Data from January 2018 to March 2022 from Línea 100, a national toll-free hotline service for survivors of domestic violence, were used. A quasi-experimental research design with controlled interrupted time series analysis was applied. The number of monthly calls reporting domestic violence was the outcome variable, while the sex of the callers was the treatment variable.
Results
A significant increase in the number of calls was found during strict lockdown compared to the previous period. In addition, a decrease in the number of calls after confinement was observed. In all analyses, women were the most affected by domestic violence before, during and after lockdown.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic violence in Peru. The findings highlight the need to strengthen domestic violence prevention and care services, especially during crisis situations such as the pandemic. Also, better targeted intervention strategies aimed at protecting women and promoting safe environments within the home are needed.},

We observe a significant and substantial negative effect of school closures on student reading achievement. This school closure effect remains even after controlling for measures of pandemic severity such as infection rates, vaccination policies, and a measure of lockdown stringency.

The experimentally derived preference data allow us to account for selection into remote learning while also studying selection patterns and treatment effect heterogeneity. We validate the approach using random variation from school choice lotteries. Our analysis of the average impacts of remote learning finds negative effects on reading (–0.13σ) and math (–0.14σ) achievement. Notably, we find evidence of positive learning effects for children whose parents have the strongest demand for remote learning. Parental concerns related to bullying appear to be an important driver of the demand for remote learning. Moreover, we find that across-the-board positive impacts of remote learning on bullying outcomes operate as a compensating differential for negative impacts on learning. Our results suggest that an important subset of students who currently sort into post-pandemic remote learning benefit from expanded choice.},

Slightly less than half of all children experienced very little or no learning progress. Three characteristics were strongly correlated with learning progress. First, boys were more likely than girls to experience very little or no progress. Second, children from households in the top 30\% of the income distribution were more likely to progress at the same rate as in-person classes, compared to children from lower income households. Third, comparing the different remote learning modes, internet-based learning or multiple learning modes provided children with a better chance of maintaining learning progress than other single modes.},

Using the 2017–2021 American Time Use Surveys and the 2012, 2013, and 2021 Well-being Modules, we examine how the time teens spent alone and with parents, friends, and others changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding light on how the social isolation of the pandemic disrupted this crucial development period. We also examine how time spent on various activities and where those activities took place changed during the pandemic, including the large shift to online schooling and reduction in overall time spent in class. We find that teens spent more time alone and had more leisure time during the pandemic than before, and boys spent less of their leisure time with friends. Boys saw large increases in time spent gaming and on social media, while girls increased time on social media and watching TV. We also find that socializing and communicating with others is associated with greater well-being for teens compared with other activities. These results together suggest that teens’ well-being was lower during the pandemic than before.},

	abstract = {Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n ≈ 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60\% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.},

	abstract = {Parental investments in early childhood have been shown to have a large impact on skill acquisition. In this paper, we examine how beliefs about a child’s relative skill inﬂuences investment and how these beliefs are determined. Using data from the ECLS-K, we ﬁrst show that parental beliefs about a child’s skill relative to children of the same age is distorted by a child’s skill relative to children in the same school. In other words, parents of children attending schools with high (low) average skills tend to believe their child is lower (higher) in the overall skill distribution. We then show that beliefs about a child’s skill relative to children of the same age aﬀects parental investments such as helping with homework or hiring a tutor. Thus, parents are making important investment decisions using inaccurate information. Building oﬀ our descriptive ﬁndings, we develop a model of parental investment that incorporates uncertainty about the average skill level of similarly aged children. We estimate the model using indirect inference and perform a set of counterfactuals where parents are fully informed about the average skill level in the population. We ﬁnd that investment and achievement rise by a considerable amount for students at the bottom of the skill distribution. The mechanism behind this result is that parents of children in relatively low achieving schools revise upward their beliefs about the average child in the population, inducing an investment response.},

We find that nearly 60\% of parents hold inaccurate beliefs about their child's educational performance. Parental upward biased beliefs are positively associated with both financial and time investment in their children's education. The results for financial and time investment are mainly driven by paternal and maternal upward biased beliefs, respectively, reflecting differences in credit and time constraints on each parent. We find that parental educational expectations, confidence in their child's future and parenting style are underlying mechanisms through which parental misbeliefs affect household education investment.

To evaluate this, the authors conducted a thorough analysis of recorded learning loss evidence documented between March 2020 and March 2021. This systematic review aims to consolidate available data and to document what has been reported in the literature. Given the novelty of the subject, eight studies were identified; seven of these found evidence of student learning loss among at least some of the participants while one of the seven also found instances of learning gains in a particular subgroup. The remaining study found increased learning gains in their participants. Additionally, four of the studies observed increases in inequality where certain demographics of students experienced learning losses more significant than others. It is determined that further research is needed to increase the quantity of studies produced, their geographical focus, and the numbers of students they observe.},

We found that dropout risk increased by 365\% under remote learning. While risk increased with local disease activity, most of it can be attributed directly to the absence of in-person classes: we estimate that dropout risk increased by no less than 247\% across the State, even at the low end of the distribution of per capita Covid-19 cases. Average standardized test scores decreased by 0.32 standard deviation, as if students had only learned 27.5\% of the in-person equivalent under remote learning. Learning losses did not systematically increase with local disease activity, attesting that they are in fact the outcome of remote learning, rather than a consequence of other health or economic impacts of Covid-19. Authorizing schools to partially reopen for in-person classes increased high-school students test scores by 20\% relative to the control group.},

In the years following, a growing body of literature seeks to estimate the impacts of these education disruptions on a diverse set of outcomes, including student learning. This article adds to this research by examining causal evidence through a difference-in-differences framework (DID). Results suggest that school closures led to learning losses in math for high school seniors in public schools in the Federal District (DF) in Brazil. And while all racial groups experienced learning loss, White and Asian students experienced the most significant losses in 2020. We find no evidence of learning recovery from 2020 to 2021 for any racial groups, suggesting that learning losses persisted into school reopening. We do find, however, possible signs of recovery for female senior students compared to male students. Nevertheless, male and female performance differences are still prominent when analyzing data from 2016 to 2021. The utilization of critical policy analysis and the effectively maintained inequality frameworks can offer insights into significant learning disparities experienced by students.},

This article evaluates the effects of school closures based on standardised tests in the last year of primary school in the Dutch-speaking Flemish region of Belgium. Using a 6-year panel, we find that students of the 2020 cohort experienced significant learning losses in three out of five tested subjects, with a decrease in school averages of mathematics scores of 0.17 standard deviations and Dutch scores (reading, writing, language) of 0.19 standard deviations as compared to previous cohorts. This finding holds when accounting for school characteristics, standardised tests in Grade 4 and school fixed effects. Given the large observed effect sizes, the effect of school closures appears to be a combination of lost learning progress and learning loss. Moreover, we observe that inequality both within schools and across schools rises by 7\% for mathematics and 8\% for Dutch. The learning losses are correlated with observed school characteristics, as schools with a more disadvantaged student population experience larger learning losses.},

In this paper, we use unique data to analyse how one full year of COVID-19 crisis in Dutch primary education has affected learning growth and pre-existing inequalities. We draw on a dataset that includes around 330,000 Dutch primary school students from about 1,600 schools, with standardized test scores for reading, spelling and mathematics, as well as rich (family) background information of the students. The results show a lower learning growth over a full year for all three domains, varying from 0.06 standard deviations for spelling to 0.12 for maths and 0.17 standard deviations for reading. Furthermore, we find that the lower learning growth is (much) larger for vulnerable students with a low socioeconomic background. This implies that pre-existing inequalities between students from different backgrounds have increased. These results are quite alarming and suggest that distance learningcould not compensate for classroom teaching, although it prevented some damage that would have occurred if students had not enjoyed any formal education at all.},

The existence of these deficits is a key driver of inequality and contributes to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In this article, we discuss the framework used in economics to model parental investments and early childhood development and use it as an organizing tool to review some of the empirical evidence on early childhood research. We then present results from various important early childhood interventions, with an emphasis on developing countries. Bringing these elements together, we draw conclusions on what we have learned and provide some directions for future research.},

India has over 70 million children aged 0–5 who are at risk of developmental deﬁcits. The inputs into the production functions include parental background, prior child cognition and health, and child investments, which are taken as endogenous. Estimation is based on a nonlinear factor model, based on multiple measurements for both inputs and child outcomes. Our results show an important effect of early health on child cognitive development, which then becomes persistent. Parental investments affect cognitive development at all ages, but more so for younger children. Investments also have an impact on health at early ages only.},

This article uses a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to estimate the effectiveness of guided instruction methods as implemented in under-performing schools in Chile. The intervention improved performance substantially, and equally for boys and girls. However, the effect is mainly accounted for by children from relatively higher-income backgrounds. Basing our study on the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) instrument, we document that the quality of teacher–student interactions is positively correlated with the performance of low-income students; however, the intervention did not affect these interactions. Guided instruction improves outcomes, but the challenge to reach the most deprived children remains.},

However, this approach often forces the use of strong assumptions to estimate the parameters that inform individual behavior and identify causal links. In this paper, we argue that a more flexible and broader approach to measurement could be extremely useful and allow the estimation of richer and more realistic models that rest on weaker identifying assumptions. We argue that the design of measurement tools should interact with, and depend on, the models economists use. Measurement is not a substitute for rigorous theory, it is an important complement to it, and should be developed in parallel to it. We illustrate these arguments with a model of parental behavior estimated on pilot data that combines conventional measures with novel ones.},

Second, we show how to convert the answers to the survey instrument into estimates of maternal subjective beliefs. Finally, we correlate maternal subjective beliefs with maternal investments in child development. We apply our framework to a unique dataset collected as part of an 18-month-long parenting stimulation program in Colombia, whose target population was low-income households with children aged 12 to 24 months at baseline and lasted 18 months. In this program, home visitors paid weekly visits to randomly chosen households to improve mother-child interactions and other maternal behaviors that foster the development of children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. We show that most mothers believe that the technology of skill formation follows a Cobb- Douglas parameterization, but there is significant heterogeneity in coefficients of investments across mothers. In addition, mothers hold low subjective expectations, meaning they underestimate the returns on their investments. We also find that maternal subjective beliefs predict investments but that the program did not affect maternal subjective beliefs.},

	title = {Child skill production: {Accounting} for parental and market-based time and goods investments},
	abstract = {Families invest parental time, home goods/services, and market-based child care in their children. We study these investments, focusing on two issues: the role of parental human capital and the substitutability of inputs in the skill production process. We develop a relative demand estimation strategy that uses intratemporal optimality to estimate input substitutability, as well as the relative productivity of inputs and the role played by parental education. This approach requires only a weak separability assumption on the dynamics of skills, no data on skills, and easily addresses measurement error in inputs. We show how relative demand restrictions can simplify estimation of the dynamics of skill production using (noisy) measures of skills when there are multiple investment inputs that are imperfectly measured. Finally, we show how moments related to relative demand can be combined with moments related to skill dynamics to determine whether beliefs about skill production align with the true technology. Using data from the Child Development Supplement of the PSID, we estimate the skill production technology for children ages 12 and younger, finding moderately strong complementarity between inputs. We estimate little effect of parental education on the child production technology: more-educated parents invest more, because they have higher incomes and stronger preference for children’s skills. Counterfactual simulations show that the degree of input complementarity we estimate has important implications for policies that subsidize specific inputs or provide free child care.},

We assume that, at each age, these factors interact among themselves and with a variety of other inputs to determine the level of development at following ages. Relative to other studies, the richness of the data we use allows us to: (i) let the dynamics be rich and flexible; (ii) let each factors play a role in the production of any other factor; (iii) estimate age-specific functional forms; (iv) treated parental investment as an endogenous input. We find that the dynamics of the process can be richer than usually assumed, which has important implications for the degree of persistence of different inputs in time. Persistence also changes with age. This has important implications for the targeting of investment and interventions, and the identification of windows of opportunities. The endogeneity of investment is also important.},

This chapter describes the developments in the intergenerational transmission literature since the 1999 Handbook Chapter. While there have been some important contributions in terms of measurement of elasticities and correlations, we focus primarily on advances in our understanding of the forces driving the relationship and less on the precision of the correlations themselves.},

	abstract = {We study how endowments, investments and fertility interact to produce human capital in childhood. We begin by providing empirical support for two key features of existing models of human capital: that investments and existing human capital are complements in the production of later human capital (dynamic complementarity) and that parents invest more in children with higher endowments due to the complementarity between endowments and investments (static complementarity). For the former, we exploit an exogenous source of investment, the launch of Head Start in 1966, and estimate greater gains from preschool in the IQ of those with the highest stocks of early human capital, consistent with dynamic complementarity. For the latter, we are able to overcome the potential endogeneity and measurement error associated with traditional measures of endowment based on health at birth. When we do, we find that parents invest more in highly endowed children. Moreover, we find that the degree of reinforcement increases with family size. Thus, an increase in quantity leads not only to a decline in average quality (the quantity-quality tradeoff) but to an increase in the variation in quality, due to both greater variation in endowments (from more children) and greater reinforcing investments. These findings can be explained by extending the quantity-quality trade-off model to include heterogeneous child endowments and parental preferences that feature complementarity between quality and quantity and moderate aversion to inequality in child human capital within the household.},

	abstract = {IntroductionThe global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 87\% of students around the world being affected by school closures. This led to countries around the world implementing emergency plans to help mitigate the risks of exposure and spread of the virus. Schools mobilized resources and shifted to a new modality of instruction to assure the continuity of teaching and learning: online learning. There were numerous challenges for all stakeholders involved in this dynamic new learning space. At the forefront of these challenges was the involvement of, and communication with, parents regarding their child’s education at home. The pandemic presented schools with an opportunity to connect with families and strengthen collaboration. As communication is an integral component of collaboration, this study sought to ascertain the degree to which parent-school communication and parental involvement may have changed during and after the pandemic.MethodsA quantitative approach was employed to ascertain the views of parents of students in grade one through grade four attending private schools in the UAE. The researchers constructed a 30 item, Likert-style instrument which was subsequently validated for use and internal consistency assessed. The total number of responses was 479, which were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The researchers made use of an exploratory factor analysis and Wilcoxon signed-rank test to both explore parent perceptions during and after the pandemic.ResultsThese findings suggest that adjustments in communication strategies had a significant impact on how parents perceived their communication with schools. Our results indicate a significant shift in the accessibility and effectiveness of parent-school communication, suggesting that the pandemic triggered positive change in several aspects of educational communication. Parental involvement throughout and after the pandemic displayed a multifaceted pattern. Although parents became more attentive to their children’s academic success after the pandemic, there was a decrease in their total involvement in other educational activities.DiscussionThese mixed results suggest that while there was an overall trend of decreased parental involvement during and after the pandemic, individual variations exist, highlighting the need for school leaders to consider more nuanced approaches to facilitating and supporting parental involvement. Based on the results, the authors identified six suggestions for future practice to guide school leaders in fostering effective parent-school communication practices in post-Covid learning environments. Research concerning the impact COVID-19 has had on educational leaders’ interactions with parents is limited. Indeed, the degree to which parent-school communication and parental involvement have been successful during and after the pandemic has yet to be investigated. As such, this research aims to contribute to closing this gap in literature and provide school leaders and policymakers with practical suggestions for strengthening relationships between schools and families.},

	abstract = {There is an extensive theoretical literature that postulates a trade-off between child quantity and quality within a family. However, there is little causal evidence that speaks to this theory. Using a rich data set on the entire population of Norway over an extended period of time, we examine the effects of family size and birth order on the educational attainment of children. We find a negative correlation between family size and children's education, but when we include indicators for birth order or use twin births as an instrument, family size effects become negligible. In addition, higher birth order has a significant and large negative effect on children's education. We also study adult earnings, employment, and teenage childbearing and find strong evidence for birth order effects with these outcomes, particularly among women. These findings suggest the need to revisit economic models of fertility and child “production,” focusing not only on differences across families but differences within families as well.},

	abstract = {During Vietnam's two decades of rapid economic growth, its fertility rate has fallen sharply at the same time that its educational attainment has risen rapidly—macro trends that are consistent with the hypothesis of a quantity-quality tradeoff in child-rearing. We investigate whether the micro-level evidence supports the hypothesis that Vietnamese parents are in fact making a tradeoff between quantity and “quality” of children. We present private tutoring—a widespread education phenomenon in Vietnam—as a new measure of household investment in children's quality, combining it with traditional measures of household education investments. To assess the quantity-quality tradeoff, we instrument for family size using the commune distance to the nearest family planning center. Our IV estimation results based on data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) and other sources show that rural families do indeed invest less in the education of school-age children who have larger numbers of siblings. This effect holds for several different indicators of educational investment and is robust to different definitions of family size, identification strategies, and model specifications that control for community characteristics as well as the distance to the city center. Finally, our estimation results suggest that private tutoring may be a better measure of quality-oriented household investments in education than traditional measures like enrollment, which are arguably less nuanced and less household-driven.},

Using survey and administrative data, and combining regression and matching techniques, my findings suggest a positive impact on problem solving and motor skills.

Class size variation that is exogenous to parental effort comes from interaction between enrollment and a maximum class size rule of 30 students in the lower secondary school in Norway. The class size rule is used to generate a credible instrument for class size, and moreover, the discontinuities generated by the class size rule are used explicitly to reveal potential class size effects (Quart J Econ 114 (1999) 533). The evidence is not conclusive, but there are indications that parents tend to reduce their efforts as class size increases, in particular when class size increases from low levels.},

At child age seven, for example, being one year older at school start increases maternal employment by four percentage points. At child age 15, it increases the likelihood that parents still cohabit by eight percentage points. Our results also indicate that later school start for the focal child improves older siblings’ academic performance.},

Family backgrounds are captured by race, household structure, mothers’ educational attainment, and school poverty. Exploiting discontinuities in school starting age created by North Carolina school-entry laws, we adopt a quasi-experimental approach and compare test scores of public school students whose older siblings were born shortly before and after the school-entry cutoff date. We find that individuals whose older siblings were born shortly after the school-entry cutoff date have significantly higher test scores in middle school and that this positive spillover effect is particularly strong in disadvantaged families. We estimate that the spillover effect accounts for approximately one-third of observed statistical associations in test scores between siblings, and the magnitude is much larger for disadvantaged families. Our results suggest that spillover effects from older to younger siblings may lead to greater divergence in academic outcomes and economic inequality between families.},
