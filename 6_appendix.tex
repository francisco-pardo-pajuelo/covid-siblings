\section*{Appendix B: Robustness} \label{sec:appB}

%\section{Robustness}\label{sec:robustness}

\subsection{Potential sample selection}

Discuss how siblings are observed. We only see observations as long as they are enrolled in data. Most children are enrolled in primary school \textcolor{green}{(show data from household surveys)}. However, most children are not enrolled until 3-4 years old. Since our last year of administrative data is 2024, this means that some families with 2 children, one of which was born after 2021, might be observed as only childs. To address any concerns from this selection I do the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item These families are not particularly different from others? (this true)?
    \item I use data up to 2023 and 2022 to define families (and potentially imposing a similar bias to earlier years) and still see results change around COVID. \textcolor{green}{Pending Analyis}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Siblings in same vs different schools}

\subsection{Different definitions of siblings: father, both, caretaker}

\subsection{Only children: Missreport}

What if they are mostly students leaving by themselves? And not reporting parent's IDs? How can we validate this?

\section*{Appendix D: Validating Sibling Identification} \label{sec:appD}

\subsection{Contrasting with survey responses}


\subsection{Number of siblings}

In \textcolor{green}{XX} one survey question asked about number of siblings.


\subsection{Number of people in the household}

In the 2nd grade survey in 2015 and 2016 a question asked about the number of adults and children in the household. In \textcolor{green}{XX} I show the distribution of responses by number of children estimated with matching parent IDs. 

\subsection{Potential composition of sample}

By using older siblings, it is less and less likely to see them in lower grades for later years. For example, to see an older sibling with 3 younger siblings in 2024 in first grade, they would have to have siblings within 3 years below them, otherwise they wouldn't be seen in the data. These creates two isses. First, the TWFE might be overweighting school closure years over years after schools re-opened. We address this with the time fixed effect. Another issue is that these families are likely different given the short age gap between all the children. However, this issue is less prevalent in later grades. The fact that I see similar pattern in 1st as in 6th grade assuages concerns for this.

\section*{Appendix I: Issues to resolve} \label{sec:appI}

\subsection{Administrative data vs survey data}

In some years, we can compare administrative with survey data:

\textbf{Mother's education}: \hyperref[tab:survey_educ]{Table \ref{tab:survey_educ}}
This variable compares relatively well. 

\textbf{Family members}: \hyperref[tab:survey_siblings]{Table \ref{tab:survey_siblings}}
There are significant discrepancies in this variables. Only children report having no siblings more often than the other groups although at low rates (10\% vs 1\%) and less often living with siblings (74\% vs 90\%). However, the average number of siblings and household members shows no difference between the first two groups. When looking at family members they live with, the administrative data information does not accurately predict living conditions. \hyperref[tab:survey_living]{Table \ref{tab:survey_living}}. However, the admin data about living with their mother seems to be more precise than that of living with their father. Probably better to use 'lives with mother/doesnt live with mother' categories?

\subsection{Size of effects with international evidence}

TWFE using PISA scores go as big as 0.6 SD (\hyperref[fig:pisa]{Figure \ref{fig:pisa}}). Even though the time difference is 2012 v 2022, this is a very large effect considering I am focusing on the differential effect between children with siblings and only children. Looking into it, both years measure having siblings differently.

In 2012, they ask directly for wether they live with their brothers/sister at home. This leads to an average of 82\% identified as having siblings.

In 2022, they ask directly how many siblings they have (including step-brothers/sisters). Here, the percentage of students with siblings is 91\%.

In the case of Peru, this difference is 64\% and 94\%, explaining big changes in the estimated results. We can see part of this potential bias by changes in SES between 2012 and 2022 although this could also be caused by the pandemic. \hyperref[fig:pisa_ses]{Figure \ref{fig:pisa_ses}}
