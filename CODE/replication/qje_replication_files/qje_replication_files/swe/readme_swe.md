**Sweden**
All Swedish data is individual-level registry data that can only be accessed by researchers after application to the institutions listed below. Access usually requires affiliation with a Swedish university and an approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority.

1. **Application Data**: Data for application is gathered directly from UHR, the agency currently in charge of the centralized application system, and from the National Archives. The archive is called H97.

2. **Education Data**: Further data on education outcomes is retrieved from SCB registry HÃ¶gskoleregistret.

3. **Socio-economic Data**: Individual-level registry data from SCB from the registry LISA. SCB also provides family identifiers and sibling-ties.

## REPLICATION
The main analyses combine many of these files. Since many important variables, including the ones identifying siblings, depend on propietary data, we cannot make the final datasets used for the estimations public or share it with third parties. However, you can contact us in case you need guidance with data applications or if you have any doubt about how to process the data:

- Chile: Andres Barrios-Fernandez (andres.bafer@alumni.lse.ac.uk).
- Croatia: Marin Drlje (marin.drlje@cerge-ei.cz).
- Sweden: Adam Altjmed (adam@altmejd.se).
- US: Christine Mulhern (mulhern@g.harvard.edu).
