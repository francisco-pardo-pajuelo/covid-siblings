*** STEP 1-5 GENERATES DATA, REQUIRES ABOUT 4 HRS  ON BATCH (one master file 1.3m obs and a baseline file 263K obs)
*** STEP 6-9 GENERATES ALL FIGURES, ALL TABLES AND ALL DIGITS MENTIONED IN THE PAPER, REQUIRES ABOUT 45 MINS ON BATCH
*** STEP 10-13 ARE TABLE A9 GMM TESTS, AND A SIMILAR TEST FOLLOWING A STATEMENT ON PAGE - THESE REQUIRE SEVERAL HOURS
	
	*** The output is found in the folder "\AEJ_do_files\Output  
	***								1) the subfolder "Figures" contains all figures
	***								2) tables.rtf stores all tables in a single word-file EXCEPT Tables 2, 5 (F-TESTS), 6, A1, A3 AND A8
	***								3) two log files contain analyses to complements tables (step 8) and digits from the paper (step 9) 
	***								4) separate log-files are produced for each step 10-13

******The step1-program sets up all years of applicants into one file, each individuals choices in rank-order, deleting redundant choices (e.g. choice 3 if ind i accepted to choice 2).

******The step2-program looks for improbable / potentially erroneous values of being accepted (variable name "Sint"). Essentially, if only one out of a large number of individuals is 
*accepted below a certain GPA value, this is likely to be a typo. That observation will later be dropped. Concerns only a small fraction of the sample.

******The step4-program focus on individuals accepted to 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th choice, and identfies the non-accepted program with the lowest cutoff GPA (the ind was closest to be accepted to)

******The step5-program merges the info from the ALL previous files, step1, step2, step3 & step4, and cleans up doubles (same individual applying to the same program twice in the same year/region). 
*It then goes on to merge data with explanatory variables and outcome variables from a number of administrative registers held by Statistics Sweden.
*The data sources merged include:
***			- "Avg√•ngsregister gymnasiet" which report yearly from 1973 the completion of high school majors
***			- Multiple generation register (info on parents)
***			- population data of GPA, only available from 1988 (born 1972) and only used in one number reported in the paper
***			- Foreign background 
***			- from "LISA" of Statistics Sweden is collected various variables, compiled in files with yearly data, and re-modeled to age-specific data 
***					(e.g. age 38 occurs in different years for diff birth-cohorts), including occupation (ssyk), income (ForvInk), income including parental and sick-leave (SjukRe ForPeng),  
***					level of education completed (sun), field of study completed (inr)
