README

This repository contains the necessary STATA code to replicate the paper “High school majors and future earnings” by Gordon Dahl, Dan-Olof Rooth and Anders Stenberg. 

The Stata program “main.do” calls all of the required programs. The main.do file provides an explanation of what each of the programs do. 
The repository only contains Stata program and not the underlying data as these are confidential register data. Information on how to access this data is provided in the Data Availability statement.
